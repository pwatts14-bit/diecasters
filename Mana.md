Mana is used to [[Delve]] and to [[Summon Creatures]] at a distance.

Summoning a Creature 1 Hex away from you costs 3 Mana, 2 Hexes costs 6 Mana, and 3 Hexes costs 9 Mana

Delving costs 2 for the first, 3 for the second, 4 for the third.

Mana can also be used at any time to [[Bump]] the value of any die up by 1. Doing this costs 1 Mana the first time on a turn, and 2 the second (increasing by 1 each subsequent time).
