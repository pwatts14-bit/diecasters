Summoning [[Creatures]] is the primary way to score points in Diecasters. Each [[Creatures|Creature]] that is available to summon is on the right side of the [[Main Game Board]], along with the cost to Summon each [[Creatures|Creature]]. 

First, pay the cost in [[Resources]] from your [[Supply]]. Then, place the [[Creatures|Creature]] hex in your color on the [[Main Game Board]] in the Space occupied by your [[Sorcerer Token]] or you may pay [[Mana]] to Summon it at a distance. The cost to do this is 3 [[Mana]] per Hex away from your [[Sorcerer Token]].

You may Summon as many [[Creatures]] as you have the [[Resources]] to pay for.

When you have finished, move on to [[Modify your Spellbook]].
