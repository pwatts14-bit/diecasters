Cards in your hand or your [[Spellbook]] can only be played by pairing them with one or more of your available dice.

For cards in your hand, choose a card to play, place it on the table, and place one of your available dice on top of the card. Then, take the action on the card that corresponds to the die you placed on the card. Leave the die on the card to indicate that the card has been used. If the card returns the die to the player's available dice pool, twist the card sideways to indicate that it has been used.

For cards in your [[Spellbook]], place the die on the card in your Spellbook in the same manner and then activate the card. If the card returns the die to the player's available dice pool, slide the card down, exposing the "Depleted" text on the board under it to indicate it has been used for this turn.

When you have finished, move on to [[Delve]].
