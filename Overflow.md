Overflowing occurs when the value of a die is increased to a number greater than 6.

To Overflow a die, re-roll the die that was Overflowed, then get a second die from the Supply and set it to whatever value would be needed to add to it to make the new value. If it is not possible to do this with a single die, re-roll again until it is. 

Example: a 6 die is [[Bump]]ed to 7. The original 6 die is rerolled and becomes a 4. A new die is added with a value of 3 so that the original 4 and 3 add up to the new value of 7. The original 6 has Overflowed into a 4 and a 3.
