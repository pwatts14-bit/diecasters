Your Spellbook can be filled with Spells from your hand so that they stay available from one turn to the next. At the beginning of the game, your Spellbook has only a single page for you to put a [[Spell]]. The size of your Spellbook can increase throughout the game as your [[Training Token]] advances. When it reaches the first space above the next page of your Spellbook, you may remove the blocking card from that page, making it available to hold another Spell for the rest of the game. The maximum size of your Spellbook is 5 pages, each holding only 1 Spell.
