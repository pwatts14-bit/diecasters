At the beginning of the game, you will roll 2 white dice every turn. When you have reached the dice space of your [[Training Track]], you will add a third white die to roll every turn for the rest of the game. These dice should remain in your [[Dice Tray]] until they have been used.

When you have finished this, move on to [[Perform 'Each turn' actions from Relics]].
