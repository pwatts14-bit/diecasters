To [[Acquire]] new Spells from the [[Archive]] or [[Tome]], you must spend [[Gold]] that you have accumulated on your current turn. [[Gold]] that is not spent will not be retained for future turns, unless you use it to purchase a [[Gold Coin]], which costs 2 [[Gold]].

You may purchase any number of Spells from the [[Archive]] or [[Tome]], as long as you have the [[Gold]] to do it. Spells in the [[Archive]] are not [[Replenished]] immediately after being acquired -- only at the end of the turn.

Once this phase is completed, move on to [[Summon Creatures]].
