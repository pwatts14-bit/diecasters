You may modify your [[Spellbook]] by adding any number Spells you have played this turn or from your hand and/or removing Spells that are already in your [[Spellbook]]. The number of Spells you can have in your [[Spellbook]] is limited by the advancement of your [[Training Token]]. Only pages beneath your [[Training Token]] or to the left of it are available.

Once you have finished this, move on to [[Discard hand and return dice]].
