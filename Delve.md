Delving lets you discard a card in the [[Archive]] and draw a new one to replace it with. This allows you to try to find cards that are better suited for your deck than what is available when you are ready to [[Acquire]].

To Delve, you simply discard the first (far left) card in the [[Archive]] (or first X cards where X is how many Delves you are electing to carry out), then slide the other cards to the left to fill in the spaces. Finally draw new cards to fill the right end of the [[Archive]]. 

Delving takes place in two phases. First, you declare how many times you are going to delve. You may delve any number of times from 0 up to the number of available pages in your [[Spellbook]] (even if they are occupied with Spells), aka your [[Power Level]]. You must Delve the number of times you declare even if you find a card you'd like to [[Acquire]]. If you haven't found a card you'd like to [[Acquire]], you may then Delve again by paying [[Mana]]. The first [[Mana]] Delve costs 2, the second costs 3, and the third costs 4. You may not Delve more than this because you cannot possess enough Mana to pay for more.

After Delving, move on to [[Acquire new Spells from the Archive or Tome]].
